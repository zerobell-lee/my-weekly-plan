## Result

### Blog-result

* Pytube with ffmpeg
  * Suddenly my code didn't work. I don't know why.
  * So I handled that by recode it.
  * However it works unproperly until now. I have to inspect it.

Rate : 4/5

* Retrospective(현미농)
  * Initial layout should have had to be revised.
  * I didn't need to separate "Approach" and "Implementation".
  * I don't like the layout of my blog. Have to think about a better template.

Rate : 5/5

### Study-result

* Operating System
  * I just took 3 chapters.
  * I didn't like taking online courses. So I put this item at the bottom of priority.
  * After finishing other tasks, I felt satisfied because it meant I completed my plan at almost 70%.
  * That's why I failed to finish taking 10 chs.

Rate : 1/5

### Side Projects-result

* HUFSuploader
  * It works! When I tried imsidir, it worked. But I'm doubting imsidir was important. 임시dir를 시도했을 때도 처음엔 이미지 에러가 떴었다. 그러나 시간이 지나니 사진이 정상적으로 표시 되었음. 예전에 올린 것도 사실 기다리면 되었던 걸지도 모른다.
  * React-route. I have to study about HashRouter and BrowseRouter.
  * I have to refactor my codes and decorate UI.
  * I have to handle with some exceptoins, such as timeout.

Rate : 4/5

* 현미농
  * I didn't do anything about 현미농.
  * I'll add codes about db.
